Introduction
Phishing websites are a serious cybersecurity risk because they mimic trustworthy platforms to trick users into divulging private information like passwords, usernames, and bank account information. In order to get users to take action, these phony websites frequently use strategies like imitating legitimate domains or employing frightening language.
Phishing website detection is a crucial duty that calls for reliable, scalable, and effective solutions. Conventional detection techniques, such human inspection and blacklists, have a narrow scope and find it difficult to stay up with attackers' changing tactics. However, by seeing minute patterns and connections in the data that point to phishing activity, machine learning (ML) provides a dynamic method.
Understanding the Detection Workflow
The workflow for phishing website detection combines data-driven insights with ML algorithms to ensure reliable and efficient classification. Below are the critical steps involved in the process:
 
1.	Data Collection:
o	A dataset of URLs is curated, containing labeled examples of phishing and legitimate websites.
o	Metadata such as domain age, URL length, and keyword presence are included to provide a comprehensive view of the website characteristics.
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Key features are extracted from the dataset, focusing on attributes like:
	URL length: Longer URLs often indicate phishing attempts.
	Domain metadata: Younger domains are commonly associated with phishing.
	Presence of special characters or suspicious keywords like "login," "free," or "secure."
3.	Model Training:
o	Machine learning models, such as Random Forests, are trained using the extracted features. These models learn patterns in the data to classify websites accurately.
4.	Prediction:
o	The trained model is used to analyse new URLs and predict whether they are phishing or legitimate.
Dataset Overview
 
A synthetic dataset was generated for this project to simulate real-world phishing and legitimate websites. The dataset captures key characteristics of phishing attempts while maintaining balanced representation for unbiased training and evaluation.
Key Attributes:
•	Number of Samples: 1,000 examples split evenly between phishing and legitimate websites.
•	Features:
o	URL length, domain age, and special character presence.
o	Suspicious keyword frequency within the URL and metadata.
•	Target Variable: Binary classification where 1 represents phishing and 0 represents legitimate websites.
This dataset effectively captures the features and variability typically encountered in real-world scenarios, enabling robust model development.

Results and Insights
Performance Metrics:
•	Accuracy: The Random Forest model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95%, highlighting its ability to reliably distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones.
•	Precision: High precision for phishing websites ensures minimal false positives, making the model trustworthy for real-world deployment.
•	Recall: Strong recall indicates the model's capability to identify a vast majority of phishing attempts, ensuring robust detection.
•	F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, demonstrating the model's overall effectiveness.
 
Feature Insights:
•	Features such as URL length, presence of suspicious keywords, and domain metadata emerged as the most influential in classifying phishing websites.
•	Legitimate websites typically exhibited longer domain ages and a lack of misleading keywords or special characters.

2.	Interpretable Results: Feature importance metrics provide transparency in the model's decision-making.
3.	Versatile Features: Handles a wide range of features, including textual and numerical data.
Limitations
1.	Real-Time Application: Although effective, the model may need further optimization for real-time processing in browsers or APIs.
2.	Feature Extraction: Complex phishing websites with dynamic content or obfuscated scripts may evade detection without advanced feature extraction.
3.	Synthetic Data: While the synthetic dataset captures general patterns, a real-world dataset may introduce unforeseen challenges.
Applications
1.	Browser Security: Integrated phishing detection in web browsers to alert users of malicious websites in real time.
2.	Enterprise Solutions: Protect employees and corporate networks from phishing scams targeting sensitive data.
3.	E-commerce Platforms: Prevent phishing attempts aimed at impersonating legitimate online stores.
